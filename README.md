# Home_Sales

For this homework assignment, I utilized my knowledge of SparkSQL through Google Colab to determine key metrics about home sales data from a specific dataset.

I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache/uncache a temporary table, and verified that the table was uncached.
I worked with a few classmates via Discord to complete this assignment, we also looked back at past assignments for reference.
